# KITTI dataset viewer
This project is forked form [3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer](https://github.com/hailanyi/3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer), great thanks to the author.

The main change is to vis detection result and tracking result(including single 2d and 3d result from the corresponding detectors, rather than the fusion result). So that we can clearly see the difference between the three.

## TODO
✅ Building the running environment and fork the project
❎ Add 2d/3d detection result on the tracking viewer
❎ Add the single 2d/3d result on the tracking viewer
❎ Add the trajectory of each object
